# Encrypt
This project implements a basic file encryption system using the XTEA (eXtended Tiny Encryption Algorithm). It allows users to encrypt and decrypt files using a 256-bit key. The project demonstrates how to handle file encryption and decryption, padding, checksum for data integrity, and key management for educational purposes.
